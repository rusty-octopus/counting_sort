# Todo

* Use flamegraph to optimize
  * [https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph]
  * Does this work with criterion, or do I need an example application?
  * [Automatic Flamegraphs for Benchmarks in Rust](https://www.jibbow.com/posts/criterion-flamegraphs/)
  * [Iai](https://github.com/bheisler/iai)
* Clone of iterator? Rework?
* Parallelisation
* Add fuzzing
